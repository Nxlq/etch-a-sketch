# etch-a-sketch
this is a project building something I have never done before,
something between a sketchpad and an etch-a-sketch within the browser.

this project provided experience working with the DOM, DOM Methods, events and creating code structure
that can be changed dynamically upon changing the value of 'currentSetting' variables.
